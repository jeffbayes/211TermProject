This is the OMGWTF project directory for the cis211 TermProject.

At the end of the term, your project will be scored on wether all of the patterns discussed over the term have been implemented in your project. We also expect you to push updated code and file a report on the term project at least once a week; these weekly check points are used to demonstrate that you are making an effort to work with the course material over the duration of the term. You may push and report as frequently as you like.


What happens to my report?
Each morning, all of the reports from all of the students for the previous day are emailed to the 211staff email address. If we see items in your report that indicate your project may be running off track, we may respond via email to you. We're also reviewing the reports to get a sense of how your work and skills are progressing.

If you are having specific problems, you should send email to 211staff rather than expecting us to catch the issue via your report. Email will give you a more timely response; we try to respond to all email, we will not be able to respond to all reports due to limited time.


What happens to my code?
From time to time, at least once a week, we'll be cloning everyone's project and trying to run the code. We'll be looking at your most recent push, with respect to the time we ran the check out. This is good for you because any comments we may email to you will be based on your recent activity rather than a week old zip file. We will likely comment infrequently regarding your code on account of limited time. 

If there are particular things you'd like us to look at in your code, with respect to design/implementation, a conversation during office hours will probably be the most effective strategy. A reasonably good fallback strategy will be to send email to 211staff let us know what in particular you'd like some feedback on.
