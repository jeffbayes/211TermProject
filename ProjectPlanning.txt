My goal with this is to create a simulation with the goal being a battle based on the combat principles of Dungeons and Dragons, 4th edition.
Entities would include a melee-based animate, physical ranged animate (bow and arrow), and wizard animate (magic).
Each of these will possess inanimate weapons that the animates can interact with, and each of the entities will interact with each other using basic attacks,
ultimately with the goal of killing the opposing entity. Location objects I could potentially implement are towers, walls, and caves.
Because of the need to use line of sight as a ranger, a wall or tower between him and their target would prevent the ranger from firing.
Ultimately, my goal with this is to create a much larger-scale simulation where I could have two factions of mixed warriors, rangers, and wizards fighting.

All of my animates will have a unique move distance, set of attacks (probably two), basic defenses, and a health or hitpoints that are affected by the actions of other animates.
As according to Dungeons and Dragons (D&D), each of the attacks will require a certain range to attack or be effective, and a random “roll” out of 20 to determine if the
attacks hit or not. Upon landing, another “roll” (randint) will determine the damage. The weapon of choice by each of the animates will modify both rolls.
If the attack roll breaks the defender's defenses,  then the attack lands and reduces the defender's hitpoints by the damage roll's amount.

The move distance used by the animates will relate to x and y coordinates, similar to the coordinates used in lab 2. The ranger will probably have the
greatest move distance because of the stereotypical agility given to rangers. Next will be warriors, and last will be wizards. Distances will also be involved in attacks:
warriors will require a distance of 1 or 2 to attack, and rangers and wizards will probably have attacks at range 5 or 10. In the event that I get really bored and start
implementing complicated stuff, I may have a very high range on the ranger's attack, but give a negative penalty to their attack “roll” if they attempt to land it outside
of their “accurate” range.

I absolutely think this project has the potential to be fleshed out fully to a very complicated and complete program, or implement a very basic version of this to
satisfy the requirements of the term projects. However, because I have external motivation to make this as complete and thorough as possible, I have high anticipations
for this project and hope that I will be able to fully create the program as I have it imagined.

The default Character as defined in the class will be a civilian: unarmed, no weapons, and basic stats.
Each of the individual classes will change stats to fit their respective roles. I am beginning with a singular "defense" stat that can be later expanded into the four defenses:
Armor Class(AC), Reflexes, Fortitude, and Willpower. Also, the standard "critical hit" has not yet been implemented.

The move function in particular will be a bit tricky to implement. The wizard and ranger don't care how close they are to each other as long as their attacks are in range.
However, the warrior will want to be as close as possible to its target, and the wizard and ranger will both want to keep their distance from the warrior.
